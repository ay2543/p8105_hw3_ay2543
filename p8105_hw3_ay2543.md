# Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illustrative examples of
observations. Then, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

-   Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
    aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.
-   Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
    aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
    vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered
    in your table.
-   Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

– The instacart dataset has **1384617 observations and 15 variables**.
Some key variables are *user_id, product_id, order_number,
order_hour_of_day, order_dow*. This is a preview of the dataset:

``` r
head(instacart) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

-   How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarise(n_order = length(order_id)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_order))
```
